# Get Checkbox Selections
*There are 4 options displayed as Checkbox.  And I would like to get which options are selected by user.*

1. The 4 options are represented by 1, 2, 4, 8.<br>
   Option 1 --> **1**<br>
   Option 2 --> **2**<br>
   Option 3 --> **4**<br>
   Option 4 --> **8**

2. The sum of selected Options will send to backend.<br>
   e.g. 1: If user selects **Option 1** & **Option 4**, backend will recive **9**(1+8) in this case.<br>
   e.g. 2: If user selects **Option 1** & **Option 3** & **Option 4**, backend will recive **11**(1+2+8) in this case.
